# Start-LabADPopulate 
	When you need to test Active Directory in a lab with sample users, creating sufficiently realistic test accounts is a time consuming and tedious process. There are a few quick scripts for creating something similar but many of them only create basic users which donâ€™t emulate a production environment very well.

# Start-ManagerMailMerge
	Sometime it's nessessary to email an individual about multiple people. Sometimes, its nessessary to email loads of people about loads of people.

	I needed a way to email managers about staff in their team who were recieving new equipment. As this was multiple people in multiple teams with multiple managers it was a bit out of the scope of what mailmerge is designed to handle.
